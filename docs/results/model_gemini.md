# Eval results — `model_gemini`

> **The provider-contrast arm, renamed from `model_groq` and unmeasured this round.** With
> the six ablation arms moved onto Groq, an arm named `model_groq` would have BEEN the
> baseline rather than a contrast to it, so it was re-pointed at Gemini and renamed to say
> what it runs — a stale name over a different provider is the label/behaviour mismatch this
> project keeps getting caught by.
>
> All 6 repair calls 429'd on Gemini's daily quota (0 applied, $0.00), so it reports T1
> alone at 0.396. The cost/accuracy/latency frontier this arm exists to chart is unmeasured.
> The earlier `model_groq` data (20 applied patches, $0.0116) is not shown here — different
> configuration, correctly excluded by D77 — but it is what D78's cross-provider claim
> rests on.

**7 repos** — 1 full green (every seed passed), mean pass rate 0.396, total cost $0.00

No confidence interval below — this table reports one arm in isolation. Bootstrap 95% CIs are computed when combining arms into `main.md` (`write_main_report`, a separate step over every arm's own repos).

Diff-similarity (docs/phase-5-eval.md): 0.216 [0.075, 0.376] (n=7/7) line jaccard, 0.541 [0.330, 0.755] (n=7/7) symbol precision, 0.616 [0.380, 0.813] (n=7/7) symbol recall. `—` per repo below means not measured (no human ground-truth diff, or neither side touched a Python file), not a real 0.0.
